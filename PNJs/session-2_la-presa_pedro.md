### Punch Reload

After suffering a big hit, you clench your fists and keep on fighting.

Gain a Free Re-roll when defending or saving others, or when acting selflessly.


### AUTOMATIC WEAPONS

The Enemies are armed with tommy guns or similar automatic weapons.

Heroes who fail to score at least a Basic Success during their Reaction Turn become Nervous. If they are already Nervous, they lose 1 additional Grit.

The Enemies are experts in hand-to-hand combat.
