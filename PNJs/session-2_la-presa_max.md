## Habilidades

### BEAST (MIDNIGHT WARS, ENEMY FEATS, 2 FP)

The Enemy are werewolves in their beast form, or other similar wild creatures.

Attacking the Enemy while in Melee or Close Range requires an Action Roll (ðŸ’€).

Heroes suffer -1 when rolling to hit the Enemy with firearms or ranged weapons.

### Combo

(Cost âš¡)

After each strike, there is always another, faster than the first. One-two! Come on! 

After hitting an Enemy, you can spend 1 Adrenaline to deal 1 additional Grit. You can spend several to continue the combo and deal additional damage.


### Punch Reload

After suffering a big hit, you clench your fists and keep on fighting.

[Quick Action] Once per combat, after failing a Reaction Roll against an Enemy, you can stand back up and immediately gain 1 Adrenaline.


### SELFLESS

You always defend other people with your life. Youâ€™re a true hero!

Gain a Free Re-roll when defending or saving others, or when acting selflessly.


### AUTOMATIC WEAPONS

(ENEMY FEATS, 1 FP)

The Enemies are armed with tommy guns or similar automatic weapons.

Heroes who fail to score at least a Basic Success during their Reaction Turn become Nervous. If they are already Nervous, they lose 1 additional Grit.


### FIGHTERS

(ENEMY FEATS, 1 FP)

The Enemies are experts in hand-to-hand combat.

Heroes suffer -1 when rolling to hit the Enemy without firearms or ranged weapons.


### NOSFERATU

(MIDNIGHT WARS, MONSTROUS FEATS, VAMPIRES ONLY)

You are a child of the night, born again with a thirst for blood.

Gain a Free Re-roll to all Nerves rolls. When you feed on human blood, you may heal from one Condition of any kind.

Weakness: You suffer -1 to all rolls made against Anti-vampire guns.

If you are exposed to sunlight, you cannot call on your Monstrous Feats and look Tired. If you do not return to the shadows on the next turn, you become Nervous, then Hurt, then Broken. From the fifth turn onward, you must take a spin on the Death Roulette every turn.
