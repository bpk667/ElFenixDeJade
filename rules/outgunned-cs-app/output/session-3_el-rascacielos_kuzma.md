## Habilidades

### Shadow

Nobody can catch you. You’re quick and quiet as a shadow.

Gain a Free Re-roll when hiding, sneaking, or tailing someone.


### Counter

(Cost ⚡)

The best defense is always a good offense.

React against an Enemy by rolling Brawn+Fight instead of the requested Skill. You ignore all -1s from Conditions and circumstances.


### Flying Kick

(Cost ⚡)

No enemy is out of reach for your deadly kicks.

Attack an Enemy within Close or Medium Range, gain +1 to the roll.

Additionally, you can always attack an Enemy within Close Range while bare-handed, and you don’t need to spend Adrenaline to do so.


### IMMORTAL

(MIDNIGHT WARS, ENEMY FEATS, 3 FP)

The Enemy is an ancient being, almost impossible to kill.

Common weapons and bare-handed attacks have no effect on the Enemy.

The Heroes can only wound them when using weapons or bullets the Enemy is vulnerable to.


### SHARP BLADES

(ENEMY FEATS, 1 FP)

The Enemies are armed with knives, claws, or sharp swords.

Heroes who fail to score at least a Basic Success during their Reaction Turn become Hurt. If they are already Hurt, they lose 1 additional Grit.

Heroes with kives or swords ignore this Feat.


### DARK GIFT

(MIDNIGHT WARS, SPECIAL ACTION, Cost 3 ⚡)

The Enemy infects a Hero with their curse. Maybe as a punishment, maybe by mistake. The Hero adds 2 Lethal Bullets to their Death Roulette, and they must take a spin on the Death Roulette.

If the Hero survives, they immediately gain the Damned Feat.


### DARK INFLUENCE

(MIDNIGHT WARS, SPECIAL ACTION, Cost 2 ⚡)

The Enemy locks eyes with a Hero or charms a Hero with the sound of their voice.

The Director rolls a numeric die:
1. The Hero is locked in a waking nightmare. (They skip the next Action Turn and become Nervous.)
2. The Hero becomes Angry and attacks an ally. (Another Hero risks losing 3 Grit.)
3. The Hero is charmed. (They become Distracted and suffer -1 when attacking the Enemy.)
4. The Hero has flashing visions. (They skip the next Action Turn and become Confused.)
5. The Hero is paralyzed by panic. (They skip the next Action Turn and become Scared.)
6. The Hero cannot control their body and is forced to harm themselves. (They become Hurt.)


### BLOODSUCKING

(MIDNIGHT WARS, SPECIAL ACTION, Cost 2 ⚡)

The Enemy grabs a Hero and drains them of blood or vital energy.

The Director rolls a numeric die. A Hero loses an amount of Grit equal to the result of the roll, and the Enemy recovers the same amount of Grit.


### NOSFERATU

(MIDNIGHT WARS, MONSTROUS FEATS, VAMPIRES ONLY)

You are a child of the night, born again with a thirst for blood.

Gain a Free Re-roll to all Nerves rolls. When you feed on human blood, you may heal from one Condition of any kind.

Weakness: You suffer -1 to all rolls made against Anti-vampire guns.

If you are exposed to sunlight, you cannot call on your Monstrous Feats and look Tired. If you do not return to the shadows on the next turn, you become Nervous, then Hurt, then Broken. From the fifth turn onward, you must take a spin on the Death Roulette every turn.


### BITE

(MIDNIGHT WARS, MONSTROUS FEATS, Cost ⚡)

You plunge your fangs in your victim to feast on their blood or their pain.

After landing a blow on an enemy in Melee or Close Range, you may spend 1 Adrenaline to bite them and recover 3 Grit.


### MIND CONTROL

(MIDNIGHT WARS, MONSTROUS FEATS)

You can breach through the defenses of the human psyche thanks to your powers or super-human instincts.

Gain a Free Re-roll to all rolls made to charm or intimidate others.

(⚡) [Quick Action] Gain access to a person’s mind to try to sway their actions.

In combat, this skill allows you to find 2 Enemy Weak Spots and choose the one you prefer.
