# Combat

During combat, regardless of whether it’s a shoot-out or a nice fist-fight, there are two alternating turns:

* **Action Turn:** Heroes are free to take any action they want and make the relevant Action Rolls. Additionally, all Heroes also can take a Quick Action for free.
    * *_Johnny:_ I jump out from cover and open fire on the goons.*
* **Reaction Turn:** The Director states the Enemies’ actions and all Heroes must defend themselves with a Reaction Roll (💀).
    * *Director: The goons come toward you with guns blazing. Everyone, roll Brawn+Stunt to duck out of the way.*

Action Turns and Reaction Turns keep alternating until the Heroes manage to defeat the Enemies, until the opposite happens, or until combat is interrupted.

## Action Turn

During an Action Turn every Hero can make a Quick Action for free as well as an Action Roll. A Hero can choose whether to use their Quick Action before or after making their Action Roll.

When taking their Quick Action, a Hero can grab or toss an object, reload a weapon, reach an Enemy who is in Close Range, or take another quick and easy action.

When making their Action Roll, on the other hand, a Hero can take any kind of complex action, including attacking the Enemy.

To attack an Enemy, the Hero must make a roll with difficulty equal to the Enemy Defense. For every appropriate success scored, the Enemy loses 1 Grit.

For example, if you’re attacking an Enemy with Basic Defense and score 2 Basic Successes, the Enemy loses 2 Grit. If you score a Critical Success, they lose 3 Grit.

As a general rule, all actions that directly involve the Enemy will have difficulty equal to their Defense, while all collateral actions can have a different difficulty chosen by the Director, much like what happens out of combat.

Usually, when attacking an Enemy in melee, you roll Brawn+Fight, but feel free to get creative with your actions. There is no limit to the skills and attributes you can call into play to give your opponent a hard time.

For example, you can roll Nerves+Drive to ram your car into your enemies, or roll Focus+Fix to knock some scaffolding down over their heads. Any action that might hurt, tire, discourage, or chase away your enemies will result in them losing some Grit.

## Reaction Turn

During a Reaction Turn, the Director describes the action of the Enemies and asks all Heroes involved in combat to make a Reaction Roll (💀).

This means that all Reaction Rolls made during combat are Dangerous Rolls.

What else did you expect?

When facing an Enemy, the difficulty of Reaction Rolls is equal to the Enemy Attack.

If you fail, you’ll have to lose some Grit, but you can still spend smaller successes to do some Damage Control.

If you have any doubt about what roll you should ask the Heroes to make, here is a practical list of examples. Feel free to come up with your own Reaction Rolls, choose from this list, or even roll at the beginning of the turn to randomize the Reaction.

1. The enemies attack you with fists and metal bars. Roll Brawn+Fight
2. The enemies shoot at you. Roll Brawn+Stunt
3. The enemies try to crush or choke you. Roll Brawn+Endure
4. The enemies try to push you the ground. Roll Brawn+Force
5. The enemies throw tables and chairs at you. Roll Nerves+Stealth
6. The enemies try to surround you. Roll Nerves+Awareness

As a general rule, all Heroes taking part in combat must make the same Reaction Roll. If a Hero is outside of the enemy’s range, the Director can decide that they automatically pass the Reaction Roll. At least until someone reaches them, or directs fire onto them.

## Different Reactions

Usually, all Heroes fighting against the same Enemy defend themselves by making the same Reaction Roll with the same Attribute and Skill. This keeps the game easy and quick and helps with clarity at the table.

In corner cases, when the Director feels like the clash could benefit from some added complexity, they may ask each Hero to make a different Reaction Roll based on their situation.

This strategy can help you create more exciting, fast-paced scenes, but you should bear in mind that it will make combat noticeably longer.

## Extra Reactions

As usual, you can spend extra successes rolled during a Reaction Turn to take extra actions.

If you score an extra success that is at least equal to the Enemy Defense, you can use it to counterattack.

When you counter, the Enemy loses 1 Grit as they would when you attack.

Let’s say you’re making a Reaction Roll against an Enemy with Critical Attack and Defense and score 2 Critical Successes. You use 1 success to defend, and can spend the second to counter and cause the Enemy to lose 1 Grit.

If you have the needed successes, you can even counter several times in one turn.

You can also spend extra successes scored during a Reaction Turn to protect your friends who may have failed their Reaction Rolls.

Let’s say you and a friend are making a Reaction Roll against an Enemy with Critical Attack. You score 2 Critical Successes, while your friend fails. You use 1 success to defend yourself, and can spend the second to protect your friend, granting them your success.

Remember that you can only protect your friends if you have the needed success, and you can NOT use lower successes to do Damage Control for them.

## Example

**Director:** The goons suddenly surround you. They are many more than you. They bang metal bars and shake chains to show you that they’re serious.

You’re facing an Enemy with Basic Attack and Defense!

**Savar:** “Hey, hey! Chill, mate!” I step forward with my hands up to show them that I am unarmed. “I’m certain we can reach an...” I don’t even get to the end of the sentence and try to sucker punch the goon straight in the face.

**Director:** Ok! I’d say this combat begins with an Action Turn then.

**Savar:** Nice. I use my Quick Action to get closer and roll Smooth+Fight, since I’m using my pretty brass face to distract him before hitting him.

I roll 6 dice and get a nice Critical Success. In your face!

**Director:** The goon leading the gang points at you mockingly while you get closer... But quickly stops laughing when your right hook strikes, sending two teeth flying and dropping him on his ass. The Enemy has Basic Defense and you rolled a Critical, so they lose 3 Grit.

It’s a big hit.

**Sam:** Apparently things went south quickly... I think that Savar can handle himself nicely, even if I’m tempted to join. I jump on another goon and start bashing some heads.

I roll Brawn+Fight and score a Basic Success “Take that, you jerk!”

**Director:** You pass the Enemy’s defense and deal 1 Grit. You grab one of the goons and repeatedly hit them while the others look at you and start questioning their choices.

Now that you’ve acted, it’s time for a Reaction Turn!

The Enemies grab at you from all sides, trying to pull you to the ground. React with Brawn+Force.

**Savar:** I roll 5 and get... 2 Basic Successes!

**Sam:** Basic Success for me.

**Director:** The Enemy has Basic Attack, so you both manage to dodge them. The goons try to pull you down, but you’re far too quick for them. They crowd around you, pushing from all sides, without really doing much. Savar, you also have an extra Basic Success, how do you want to use it?

**Savar:** Since the Enemy has Basic Defense, I use it to counter. When the first goon grabs my shoulder, I pivot and slam an elbow in his face.

**Director:** Ouch! The Enemy loses 1 Grit! Ready for the next Action Turn? Come on, it’s your move.


## BRAWL

A Brawl is a type of combat, with or without weapons, that involves all or most Heroes.

The rules for a Brawl allow you to manage any combat of little consequence quickly, they are ideal for fist-fights and conflicts with lower complexity.

During a Brawl, all Rolls are Action Rolls (💀). This means that with a single roll of the dice, Heroes determine both if they manage to hit the Enemy and if they were hit in turn.

If the Hero makes their Action Roll (💀) and manages to match or beat the Enemy’s Attack, then they landed a blow. If not, the Hero loses an amount of Grit to represent the blows landed by the Enemy.

As usually happens for rolls (💀), during a Brawl Heroes can use lower successes to do Damage Control.

In contrast with normal combat, during a Brawl Heroes do not take Reaction Turns, but only Action Turns. Once everyone has made their Action Rolls (💀), the Director assesses the situation and describes the scene. Then a new Action Turn begins.

> *Savar: I jump on the Enemy and hit them with a flying kick. I rolled a Critical Success.*
> *Victor: I draw my pistol and shoot point-blank... Damnit! A full-scale failure.*
> *Director: Savar hits one of the Villain’s henchmen with a kick to the face, knocking them out cold, the Enemy loses 1 Grit. Victor tries to shoot, but misses. One of the enemies takes the chance to hit him with a punch to the side. Victor, you lose 3 Grit. Back to you.*

### Enemies with Double Difficulty

When you’re in a Brawl against an Enemy with an Attack score of 2 Basic or 2 Critical, you risk losing twice the Grit.

The good news is that it only takes you ONE success of the right type to deal them 1 Grit, which means you can get in some damage even if you don’t manage to dodge all their blows.

For example, if you’re facing an opponent with 2 Critical Attack and score one Critical Success, this means that you hit each-other. The Enemy loses 1 Grit, and you lose 3. On the other hand, if you score 2 Critical Successes, it means you won across the board. The Enemy loses 2 Grit, and you’re unhurt.

### When to Opt for a Brawl

The rules for Brawls allow you to speed up and simplify combat, but are not really suited for more complex scenes, where Heroes are scattered or busy with different tasks.

When most Heroes are taking part in a fight and their only goal is getting rid of the Enemy quickly, if you don’t want to spend a long time describing the combat, you can choose to use the Brawl rules to simplify the flow of the game. Otherwise, you should use the rules for combat.

## Bang! Bang! Bang!

You can’t solve all your problems by shooting at them, but when kind words, stealthy approaches, and good old fists just don’t cut it, the only thing left to do is to make it rain bullets.

### Range

What’s range in outgunned? First of all, it’s how you determine how many actions or turns it will take you to reach your target, then it’s how you determine whether your weapon gives you a bonus or penalty to the roll.

When you’re shooting (or getting shot at), the Director decides the range by choosing between:
* Melee: Target within 2 m/yd.
* Close Range: Target at 2-10 m/yd. Can be reached with a Quick Action.
* Medium Range: Target at 10-50 m/yd. Can be reached in one turn, or with an extra Full Action.
* Long Range: Target at 50-300 m/yd. Can be reached in 2 to 3 turns.
* Out of Range: Target beyond 300 m/yd. In line of sight but beyond useful reach. There are a few weapons that can shoot Out of Range, for example, a sniper rifle.

You don’t need to use a map or grid to keep track of the distance between Heroes and Enemies. You just need to estimate the range to know how many actions the Heroes need in order to get closer to or farther from the Enemy. If you’re in doubt, you can use Medium Range for most occasions.

The Director should use range to create a dynamic scene clearly understandable to Heroes without requiring long descriptions that hinder the game and slow down the story. When in doubt, they can always use the Medium Range.

For example, the Director can declare that combat begins with the Enemies lurking at the end of the street, in Long Range, or with the Enemies menacingly stepping out of a car in Close Range. If the situation is more complex or somewhat ambiguous, the Director can consider all Enemies that are not in Melee as if they were in Medium Range.

### Cover

When you’re being shot at, you usually react with Brawn+Stunt. If you dive behind cover, you increase your chances of dodging enemy bullets, but at the same time decrease your chances of hitting the Enemy. It’s up to you.

* Partial Cover: +1 to Reaction Rolls, -1 to Action Rolls.
    * You can reach Partial Cover with a Quick Action. This means that, during your Action Turn, you can spend your free Quick Action to either reach or exit Partial Cover, before or after rolling the dice. Alternatively, you can spend any extra Basic Success to get an extra Quick Action.
    * A low wall, an upturned table, a pillar.
* Total Cover: Automatic Success to Reaction Rolls, -3 to Action Rolls.
    * You can get behind Total Cover by spending your whole turn and forgoing your usual Action Roll. Alternatively, you can also spend any extra Critical Success to get an extra Full Action and quickly throw yourself behind Total Cover. Getting out of Total Cover requires a Quick Action.
    * The corner of a building, a car, a barricade.

Always remember that you can also use Quick or Full Actions to push one of your friends behind Partial or Total Cover. You can even use a Cool Action (Extreme Success) to reach cover with another Hero.

### Mags

Around here, we don’t keep track of bullets, but only of mags. For each weapon you can carry up to three mags (plus one in the weapon), which you can note by filling in the bullets you see in the Weapons & Gear box on your Hero Sheet.

When shooting, you never consume bullets or mags. You can have fun making lead rain on your enemies. There are only 4 ways to empty a mag:
* Failure: When you fail a roll to shoot, you lose one mag. It means that you just kept shooting without really hitting your target, that your weapon jammed or misfired, or simply that that was the last bullet you had in the mag.
* Going Full Auto: When you voluntarily empty a mag against your Enemies to gain +1 to the roll.
* Covering Fire: When you shoot in all directions to force your Enemies to keep their heads down. Your friends (not you) gain +1 to their next Reaction Roll. When you lay down covering fire, you use your full turn and make no Action Roll.
* Bad Luck: As a consequence of your failure, the Director can state that one or more of your mags were lost, taken away, or that they became unusable.

### Reload
When you empty a mag, you’ll have to reload before being able to use the weap-
on again. To reload a weapon, you need a Quick Action. When all your mags are
gone, you must get more either by paying Cash or by stealing them from defeat-
ed Enemies.
To keep things simple, weapons are divided in types and each type shares a type
of mag. For example, you cannot reload an assault rifle with a pistol mag, but you
can use a pistol mag to reload any handgun model.

### A danger to others
When shooting, you must be careful not to wound oth-
er Heroes who are also fighting.
Whenever you shoot at an Enemy who is in Melee
with one or more of your friends, your Actions become
a Gamble... at the others’ expense! This means that,
if you roll one or more Snake Eyes (1), all your friends
in Melee will have to fill that many Grit boxes, and
could be quite irritated by all the bullets whizzing by
their ears.

You should also be very careful
when handling weapons with
the Explosive Feat. Using
them is always a Gamble
for yourself and the people
around you! To learn more
