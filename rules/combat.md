# Combat

During combat, regardless of whether it‚Äôs a shoot-out or a nice fist-fight, there are two alternating turns:

* **Action Turn:** Heroes are free to take any action they want and make the relevant Action Rolls. Additionally, all Heroes also can take a Quick Action for free.
    * *_Johnny:_ I jump out from cover and open fire on the goons.*
* **Reaction Turn:** The Director states the Enemies‚Äô actions and all Heroes must defend themselves with a Reaction Roll (üíÄ).
    * *Director: The goons come toward you with guns blazing. Everyone, roll Brawn+Stunt to duck out of the way.*

Action Turns and Reaction Turns keep alternating until the Heroes manage to defeat the Enemies, until the opposite happens, or until combat is interrupted.

## Action Turn

During an Action Turn every Hero can make a Quick Action for free as well as an Action Roll. A Hero can choose whether to use their Quick Action before or after making their Action Roll.

When taking their Quick Action, a Hero can grab or toss an object, reload a weapon, reach an Enemy who is in Close Range, or take another quick and easy action.

When making their Action Roll, on the other hand, a Hero can take any kind of complex action, including attacking the Enemy.

To attack an Enemy, the Hero must make a roll with difficulty equal to the Enemy Defense. For every appropriate success scored, the Enemy loses 1 Grit.

For example, if you‚Äôre attacking an Enemy with Basic Defense and score 2 Basic Successes, the Enemy loses 2 Grit. If you score a Critical Success, they lose 3 Grit.

As a general rule, all actions that directly involve the Enemy will have difficulty equal to their Defense, while all collateral actions can have a different difficulty chosen by the Director, much like what happens out of combat.

Usually, when attacking an Enemy in melee, you roll Brawn+Fight, but feel free to get creative with your actions. There is no limit to the skills and attributes you can call into play to give your opponent a hard time.

For example, you can roll Nerves+Drive to ram your car into your enemies, or roll Focus+Fix to knock some scaffolding down over their heads. Any action that might hurt, tire, discourage, or chase away your enemies will result in them losing some Grit.

## Reaction Turn

During a Reaction Turn, the Director describes the action of the Enemies and asks all Heroes involved in combat to make a Reaction Roll (üíÄ).

This means that all Reaction Rolls made during combat are Dangerous Rolls.

What else did you expect?

When facing an Enemy, the difficulty of Reaction Rolls is equal to the Enemy Attack.

If you fail, you‚Äôll have to lose some Grit, but you can still spend smaller successes to do some Damage Control.

If you have any doubt about what roll you should ask the Heroes to make, here is a practical list of examples. Feel free to come up with your own Reaction Rolls, choose from this list, or even roll at the beginning of the turn to randomize the Reaction.

1. The enemies attack you with fists and metal bars. Roll Brawn+Fight
2. The enemies shoot at you. Roll Brawn+Stunt
3. The enemies try to crush or choke you. Roll Brawn+Endure
4. The enemies try to push you the ground. Roll Brawn+Force
5. The enemies throw tables and chairs at you. Roll Nerves+Stealth
6. The enemies try to surround you. Roll Nerves+Awareness

As a general rule, all Heroes taking part in combat must make the same Reaction Roll. If a Hero is outside of the enemy‚Äôs range, the Director can decide that they automatically pass the Reaction Roll. At least until someone reaches them, or directs fire onto them.

## Different Reactions

Usually, all Heroes fighting against the same Enemy defend themselves by making the same Reaction Roll with the same Attribute and Skill. This keeps the game easy and quick and helps with clarity at the table.

In corner cases, when the Director feels like the clash could benefit from some added complexity, they may ask each Hero to make a different Reaction Roll based on their situation.

This strategy can help you create more exciting, fast-paced scenes, but you should bear in mind that it will make combat noticeably longer.

## Extra Reactions

As usual, you can spend extra successes rolled during a Reaction Turn to take extra actions.

If you score an extra success that is at least equal to the Enemy Defense, you can use it to counterattack.

When you counter, the Enemy loses 1 Grit as they would when you attack.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre making a Reaction Roll against an Enemy with Critical Attack and Defense and score 2 Critical Successes. You use 1 success to defend, and can spend the second to counter and cause the Enemy to lose 1 Grit.

If you have the needed successes, you can even counter several times in one turn.

You can also spend extra successes scored during a Reaction Turn to protect your friends who may have failed their Reaction Rolls.

Let‚Äôs say you and a friend are making a Reaction Roll against an Enemy with Critical Attack. You score 2 Critical Successes, while your friend fails. You use 1 success to defend yourself, and can spend the second to protect your friend, granting them your success.

Remember that you can only protect your friends if you have the needed success, and you can NOT use lower successes to do Damage Control for them.

## Example

**Director:** The goons suddenly surround you. They are many more than you. They bang metal bars and shake chains to show you that they‚Äôre serious.

You‚Äôre facing an Enemy with Basic Attack and Defense!

**Savar:** ‚ÄúHey, hey! Chill, mate!‚Äù I step forward with my hands up to show them that I am unarmed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm certain we can reach an...‚Äù I don‚Äôt even get to the end of the sentence and try to sucker punch the goon straight in the face.

**Director:** Ok! I‚Äôd say this combat begins with an Action Turn then.

**Savar:** Nice. I use my Quick Action to get closer and roll Smooth+Fight, since I‚Äôm using my pretty brass face to distract him before hitting him.

I roll 6 dice and get a nice Critical Success. In your face!

**Director:** The goon leading the gang points at you mockingly while you get closer... But quickly stops laughing when your right hook strikes, sending two teeth flying and dropping him on his ass. The Enemy has Basic Defense and you rolled a Critical, so they lose 3 Grit.

It‚Äôs a big hit.

**Sam:** Apparently things went south quickly... I think that Savar can handle himself nicely, even if I‚Äôm tempted to join. I jump on another goon and start bashing some heads.

I roll Brawn+Fight and score a Basic Success ‚ÄúTake that, you jerk!‚Äù

**Director:** You pass the Enemy‚Äôs defense and deal 1 Grit. You grab one of the goons and repeatedly hit them while the others look at you and start questioning their choices.

Now that you‚Äôve acted, it‚Äôs time for a Reaction Turn!

The Enemies grab at you from all sides, trying to pull you to the ground. React with Brawn+Force.

**Savar:** I roll 5 and get... 2 Basic Successes!

**Sam:** Basic Success for me.

**Director:** The Enemy has Basic Attack, so you both manage to dodge them. The goons try to pull you down, but you‚Äôre far too quick for them. They crowd around you, pushing from all sides, without really doing much. Savar, you also have an extra Basic Success, how do you want to use it?

**Savar:** Since the Enemy has Basic Defense, I use it to counter. When the first goon grabs my shoulder, I pivot and slam an elbow in his face.

**Director:** Ouch! The Enemy loses 1 Grit! Ready for the next Action Turn? Come on, it‚Äôs your move.
