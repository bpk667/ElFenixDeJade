Para esta aventura yo recomiendo **ADVANCEMENT** es mas sencilla de aplicar, el otro tipo es mas situacional y requiere algo mas de entrenamiento en el juego en si.

## ADVANCEMENT

Heroes are bright people who already have all the tools and skills to face up to any challenge they may meet on their mission. But there is always room to grow!

As you carry on with your mission, you’ll get better and stronger, growing in mind, body, and spirit, until you ultimately become the Hero we need to save the day.

For every Advancement you’ll go through during your mission, you will gain new skills that will allow you to get even better at your specialty, or to expand your skill-set into areas that you hadn’t explored yet.

### What do i get?

When you Advance, you gain:
* 2 Skill Points to assign freely.
* 1 Feat of your choice among all available, regardless of your Role and Trope.
* 1 Adrenaline as a reward for your efforts.

### When to Advance

Heroes advance after a Turning Point, and just before the Showdown begins.

Having Heroes get better right before a great challenge, and not after, might feel a bit weird, but that’s just the way of Heroes! When action knocks on their door, they are ready to answer the call and have all the tools they need to face the adversities to come.

### How much to Advance

Each Hero can advance 3 times, gaining a total of 6 Skill Points and 3 additional Feats. Then, you have reached your maximum potential. 

When a Hero who has already advanced 3 times is about to face a Turning Point or Showdown, the Player can choose to reassign 2 Skill Points of their choice and/or swap out one of their Feats for another one of their choosing. If they choose to do neither of these things, they gain 1 additional Adrenaline. It feels good to know that you already are your best self!

## Experiences

If the Advancement is a mechanical representation of the Hero’s growth and of their skills improving, Experiences mark their personal growth and the accomplishments of their adventures.

The heart of a Hero’s evolution clearly doesn’t lie in a handful of additional dice. It’s all in the Experiences they gather along the way.

*The Villain has kidnapped your daughter and run. You have one chance to stop them, but when the moment comes, you don’t have the guts to shoot. You’ll never forgive yourself.*

*The criminal you have always hated left you hanging in the void, only to come back and save your life. You were wrong about them.*

*You were falsely accused and have decided to break out of prison to prove your innocence. Now everyone believes you're a killer.*

Heroes aren’t made up of just guts and adrenaline. Their Experiences shape them along the way, forging their character and values.

An Experience is a short sentence that represents a crucial event of your life that changed you deeply.

When you face a challenge that leaves a mark, when you survive a desperate encounter, when you take part in a memorable exchange, or when you make an upsetting discovery, the Director can ask you to note down the Experience on your Hero Sheet.

**There are 4 types of Experiences:**

* **Achievement**: You have learned an important lesson, or accomplished something great. *“I’ve learned to put my trust in others.”*
* **Scar:** You’ve suffered physically, endured mental trauma, or were hugely disappointed. *“I was trapped in the flames.”*
* **Bond:** You made a bond with someone. You earned a good friend, a lover, or a bitter rival. *“Savar saved my life.”*
* **Reputation:** You’ve earned a good or bad reputation. People might have heard about you. *“I’ve put a big shot in the slammer.”*

### Gaining an Experience

When you live through a scene that leaves a mark, you or the Director can choose to turn it into an Experience to note on your Hero Sheet.

For example, when you fall madly in love, when you come out on top after a dramatic situation, when someone sacrifices themselves for you, or when you narrowly escape mortal danger, you clearly deserve an Experience.

In any case, nobody better than you can know which events will be forever carved on your heart, so don’t be shy when it comes to writing down your Experiences.

Usually, Experiences are noted down in the moment, during the same shot when they are lived through. However, in the heat of the moment, it’s understandable if you forget to mark down the Experience, or perhaps even disregard its importance.

If you haven’t gained any Experiences by the end of a shot, ask yourself:

* Have I learned a lesson at great cost?
* Have I done something truly memorable?
* Have I changed my mind about something or someone?
* Have I dealt with an important personal problem?
* Have I made a name for myself with somebody, good or bad?

If the answer to at least one of these questions was yes, you should talk with the Director and evaluate if the Experience is worth a place on your Sheet. In any case, you don’t need to gain an Experience every shot, and there is nothing wrong if you have nothing to note down at the end of a session.

A Hero should earn at least one Experience during a Cinematic Campaign, but they can also get more than one.

If, when you pass a Turning Point, there are some Heroes who still haven’t gained an Experience, this might mean that they still haven’t had a chance to shine and prove their value. It’s the duty of a good Director to keep track of who has earned an Experience and who hasn’t, so as to give every Hero the right space and time on the scene.

Finally, any time a Hero who was Left for Dead comes back into the action, they always suffer a Scar connected to their demise.

### Using Experiences

Experiences are like small Feats that can be called into play by either yourself or the Director in certain circumstances, and they can make things easier or harder for you.

When you feel like an Experience can be of Help, the Director may grant you a +1 or even an automatic success on a roll. Similarly, if either you or the Director feel like an Experience can get in the way of your actions, you may suffer a -1 or automatic failure.

For example, the Experience “I’ve learned to put my trust in others” can grant you +1 to rolls made to act in tandem with a friend. On the other hand, the Experience “I was trapped in the flames” can slap you with a -1 when you are trying to escape from a fire.

Usually, Achievements will be of Help and Scars will make life harder for you, but that’s not always the case.

For example, the Achievement “I’ve learned to put my trust in others” may impose a -1 to rolls made to understand whether a Supporting Character is lying to you or plotting against you. Similarly, the Scar “I was trapped in the flames” may grant you a +1 to rolls made to notice a candle that is rolling on the floor and possibly setting fire to the room.

Bonds and Reputations, on the other hand, can be either an advantage or disadvantage, depending on the circumstances and people involved.

*Johnny: I slowly put my gun down on the table and raise my hands to diffuse the situation. “I’m not looking for trouble. I’m certain we can come to an agreement”. I say to the boss, trying to earn their trust. I'd like to make a roll in Smooth+Speech to negotiate with the criminals.*

*Director: Your Reputation “I’ve put a big shot in the slammer” doesn’t do you any favors here. The boss is well aware of who you are and has no intention of trusting you. You can make the roll with -1.*

Keep in mind that each Experience should come into play no more than once every shot, and only in situations that are truly meaningful or dramatic.
