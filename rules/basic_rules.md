![Success Rates](./imgs/success_rates.png)

# Dificultad

- *Basic*. All rolls that concern really simple things but still hide a small chance for accidents.
		A quick and easy action or reaction. Like jumping over an obstacle, stealing the keys off of a distracted agent, throwing something.
- *Critical*. In most cases.
		Full action or reaction. Like bursting through a sturdy door, jumping out of a window, earning someone’s trust.

- *2 Critical rolls*. A happy medium between the Critical and Extreme.

- *Extreme*. Truly demanding rolls, where success is certainly not a given.
		A truly demanding action or reaction. Like picking the lock of a secure vault, shooting a speeding target at night in the pouring rain, per- suading a sworn enemy to cooperate.

- *Impossible*. Only come into play when Heroes have got ten themselves in big trouble.
		A desperate action or reaction. Like calmly exiting a car in the middle of a 180 while shooting at a tiny target, getting rid of a large group of enemies with nothing but a pencil, taking down a helicopter with a speeding car because you’re running low on ammo. Stuff from movie trailers.

## Double difficulty.

Especially complex or dangerous roll. 2 Basic, 2 Critical, or 2 Extreme.
- 2 successes to prevail.
- 1 successes. Avoid one of the consequences.
- Failure, 2 different consequences.


E.g. Boss. Require rolls with double difficulty in order for you to hit them or to avoid their blows.


## Combine successes:
- 3 Basic Successes into 1 Critical Success.
- 3 Critical Successes into 1 Extreme Success.
- 1 Critical Success like 3 Basic Successes.
- 1 Extreme Success like 3 Critical Successes.


## Re-roll (pg.68).

When: If you have scored at least one Basic Success, you can Re-roll.

How: you take all dice that weren’t part of a combination and roll them again.

After a Re-roll:
- If your result is better than the first, congratulations.
- Otherwise, you **lose one of the previously scored successes**. You choose which.

**Free Re-roll**
- You never risk losing your initial success.
- It doesn’t matter if the Re-roll gets you a better or extra success or not.
- You can make a Free Re-roll even if you didn’t score any successes on your first roll.


### All in

When: After a Re-roll or Free Re-roll if you got a better result.

How: Same as re-roll.

After all in:
- If you get a better result, Lady Luck has smiled upon you.
- Otherwise, you lose all previous successes.


## Acciones extra

Extra successes:
- Extra Basic Success: Quick Action.
- Extra Critical Success: Full Action.
- Extra Extreme Success: Cool Action.


# Help

Gear or Supporting Characters can grant you Help.
Heroes can also forgo rolling the dice to spend their turn trying to Help you face a difficult challenge.

- Gain +1 to an Action or Reaction Roll.
		Significant but not decisive Help.  
		Whenever in doubt, when a Hero can rely on some Help, grant a +1.
- Gain a Success automatically, without rolling the dice.
		When the Help is great enough to nullify the risks and possibilities of failure.
- Gain a Requisite that allows you to roll the dice.


# Adrenaline

**Gain**:  
- When you get a success against all odds
- when you make a great sacrifice
- when you give everyone strong emotions
- when you’re at the center of an epic and captivating scene.

Automatically gain 2 Adrenaline when they fill in the Hot Box on their Grit track.

**Spend**:  
- 1 Adrenaline to gain +1 to an Action or Reaction Roll.
- 1 Adrenaline to activate the special ability of some Feats.
- 6 Adrenaline to immediately gain a Spotlight.


# Spotlight

6 Adrenaline -> 1 Spotlight.

**Gain**:  
Whenever an Adrenaline would be too small of a reward. Something reward for a genius, crazy, or mind-blowing move. For example:
- When a Hero calls on their Catchphrase in epic or dramatic circumstances.
- when they do something cool in the name of their ideals.
- When a Hero calls their own Flaw into play in an interesting way, against their own interest and in spite of the consequences.



**Effect**:
- Get an Extreme Success automatically.
- Save a Friend who has lost at the Death Roulette. Your friend adds another Lethal Bullet to their roulette, but at least they won’t be dead.
- Remove a Condition of any kind, including Broken.
- Save a Ride when it’s about to be destroyed.
- Do whatever you want. If you want to do something that you normally couldn’t, discuss it with the Director. If you both agree, the Spotlight makes everything possible!

**Flip a Coin**  
After using a Spotlight and gaining its benefits, flip a coin:  
- If the result is tails, you immediately regain 1 Spotlight.
- Exception when you save the life of a friend. Then, if the result is tails, they gain 1 Spotlight.
